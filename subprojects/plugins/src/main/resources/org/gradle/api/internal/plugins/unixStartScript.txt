#
#   ${applicationName} start up script for POSIX<% if ( applicationName != 'Gradle' ) { %>
#   generated by Gradle<% } %>.
#
#   You're probably reading this because you're a Unix/Linux person and have
#   been instructed to run "gradlew" to install or build a project that's of
#   interest to you. (At least, that's how I wound up reading this script.)
#
#   Here's some stuff you need to know:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or
#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole
#       command line, like:
#
#           ksh gradlew
#
#       Even if you have a compliant shell, Java is fussy about $PWD, so you
#       might as well cd to the directory containing gradlew and run it as
#
#           ./gradlew
#
#       Any arguments you include on the command line will be passed through to
#       Java after the classname, to be available as parameters to main().
#
#   (2) This script is generated from the Groovy template file
#       subprojects/plugins/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt
#       within the Gradle project, so that's where you need to submit any
#       patches.
#
#       Gradle is a meta-build system used by the project that you're building
#       or installing. It's like autoconf but for projects that are written in
#       Java and related languages. It's also used to build parts of the Gradle
#       project itself.
#
#       Gradle is mostly written in Java and Groovy, but there are wrapper
#       scripts for various environments, including this one for POSIX shells.
#<% /*
#       ... and if you're reading this, this IS the template just mentioned.
#
#       The Groovy template language is run in two phases.
#
#        1. Any character following \ is passed unmodified through to the
#           next phase, while the \ is removed. Any other $ followed by
#           varName or {varName} is replaced by the value of that variable.
#
#        2. The result of the first phase is parsed and run in a similar
#           manner to JSP or MASON or PHP: anything within < % ... % > is a
#           code block, anything else is sent as output, subject to the
#           flow imposed by any code segments.
#
#           Yes, if you need a \ in the second phase, you need to write \\
#
#       See https://docs.groovy-lang.org/next/html/documentation/ section §3.15
#       (Template Engines) for details.
#
#       Bear in mind that the "output" is a POSIX shell script, which has its
#       own ideas about escaping with backslashes, so to get «\» you need to
#       write «\\\\» and to get «$» you need to write «\\\$».
#
#       Code segments are used in this script to control conditional inclusions:
#           (a) to build a module rather than an app, indicated by passing
#               '--module XYZ' in place of the classname that contains main
#           (b) to optionally define a ${appNameSystemProperty} symbol
#
#       These are the variables used in this script, and the defaults when
#       building Gradle itself:
#
#           ${appNameSystemProperty}    org.gradle.appname
#           ${applicationName}          Gradle
#           ${mainClassName}            org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain
#           ${optsEnvironmentVar}       GRADLE_OPTS
#           ${defaultJvmOpts}           -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 "-Xmx64m" "-Xms64m"
#
#       (These are all specified in
#       subprojects/build-init/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/tasks/wrapper/Wrapper.java
#       within the Gradle project; they may be different for other projects.)
# */ %>
#       You can find Gradle at https://github.com/gradle/gradle/.
#
#   (3) This script targets any POSIX shell, not just Bash or Ksh.
#
#       It makes use of these POSIX shell features:
#         * functions;
#         * various expansions, including «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}»,
#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;
#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;
#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».
#
#       However arrays are NOT available, except for "\$@".
#
#       The traditional practice of packing multiple parameters into a
#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security
#       problems, so this is avoided.
#
#       Instead, this script progressively modifies "\$@", which is eventually
#       passed to Java.
#
#       The is special handling for the inherited environment variables
#       DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS, and ${optsEnvironmentVar}; see the in-line
#       comments for details.
#
#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,
#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.
#
#       If submitting patches, please make sure that this script (as output by
#       the template generator) still passes shellcheck
#       (https://shellcheck.net)
